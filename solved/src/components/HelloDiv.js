// wrap everything in a parenthesis so that the arrow function understands that 
//the following lines are to be rendered

// lets talk about this arrow funstion => 
// in our case we're goung to add () because we want to take advantage of implicit return 
// within the arrow function 

//in block body, we're goint to need to wrap everything in brackets and we're going to need a return statement 

// start by creating a constant variable name
//next make a return statement with a return statment  with a () because it will be multible lines 
//and feplace name with consant variable with es6 syntax (name)
